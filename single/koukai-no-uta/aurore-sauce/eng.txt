Aurora Sauce

Lyricist: Sayuri
Composer: Sayuri

Persistently lingering, 
a shrill ear piercing sound
The reason I cried,
pressured by 
the pile of grief 
was because 
I was always 
putting things off 

Persistently lingering, 
an unforgettable memory
If I cry, pressure by
the pile of grief, 
it means 
I have lost 
something precious

Aurora sauce 
that keeps sticking 
is a punishment for me 
who keep pretending 
not to see
There is no other way 
but to drag it for a lifetime

Aurora sauce 
that keeps sticking 
I wonder since when 
I've abandoned it
Don't recover for a lifetime,
keep worm-eating me 

Persistently lingering, 
I kept deceiving it,
pretending to be asleep
Finally, 
the piled up excuses 
have begun 
to unsightly 
crumble apart

Persistently lingering, 
Finally at this stage, 
the memories 
I almost forgot 
were starting to flow 
into this room 
that had 
become empty 

Aurora sauce 
that keeps sticking 
is a punishment for me 
who keep pretending 
not to see
I can't return anymore
for a lifetime
You are going further
Bye-bye

Aurora sauce 
that keeps sticking 
is a punishment for me 
who keep pretending 
not to see
There is no other way 
but to drag it for a lifetime

Aurora sauce 
that keeps sticking 
I wonder since when 
I've abandoned it
Don't recover for a lifetime,
keep worm-eating me 
Your voice
is going further

Bye-bye
