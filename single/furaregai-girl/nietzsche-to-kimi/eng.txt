Time isn't fair
Why didn't you 
tell me earlier?
Niche, Niche

The truth is,
everything is imitation
Please don't say 
such sad things
The truth is,
everything is an illusion
I hope 
you don't notice 

Sinking in 
Momochihama beach
A fragment of philosophy 
I knew you were lying 
that you won't 
go anywhere 

Time isn't eternal
Why didn't you 
tell me earlier?
Niche, Niche

The truth is,
everything is imitation
Please don't say 
such sad things
The truth is,
everything is an illusion
I hope 
you don't notice 

You 
were laughing 
as saying,
"You can't 
ever see 
the same red or blue."
Looking at me 
with a cold face
Closing your mouth, 
showing your tears 

Sinking in 
Momochihama beach
A fragment of philosophy 
Forgive me 
for always saying
nothing but lies
that I won't go anywhere 

I was just walking through 
the Keyaki-doori road 
without any meaning
Even though you said 
""I want to go somewhere. "" 

Sinking in 
Momochihama beach
Philosophy you told me
And the one 
who went somewhere
is nobody but me
