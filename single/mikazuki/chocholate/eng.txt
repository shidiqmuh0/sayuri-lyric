I ended up loving
every thing you can't eat
I'm always composing
stories you can't devour 
I ended up loving
every thing you can't eat
I keep on dreaming
every thing you can't fulfill

I'll fall in love
with a stranger  
from somewhere
while stuffing my cheeks
with the chocolate you can't eat 

I ended up loving
every thing you can't eat
I'm stepping my feet
up to a place you can't reach

With chocolate, I've come this far
I'll definitely snatch it away
Before I get stained,
violated by its sweet smell
Before it's too late

I'll fall in love
with a stranger  
from somewhere
while stuffing my cheeks
with the chocolate you can't eat 

I'm still trying to think about
"The future I could spend with you."
Matcha and red bean flavors
as the replacement of chocolate  
We'll watch the same movie
I wanna view 
the same scene with you
I wanna walk side by side with you
"Even now, I'm still the same."
Just kidding, 
There's no way I could say that

I ended up loving
every thing you can't eat
I'm always composing
stories you can't devour
