One after another 
spilled from my mouth
Full of 
deceits, doubts, 
hypocrisy, nonsense, 
self-deprecation,
until I can't breathe 

If only I could 
live an honest life 
like that child
Sitting on the abyss of despair,
quietly straining my ears

No matter 
how many times 
I tried 
to unite myself 
with someone's stories,
the unmingled shadow 
said to me
"What are you 
living for?" 

I walked 
while dragging out
my almost breaking heart
Seeking for 
a sliver ray of hope
If you're holding this hand
that trembling in loneliness, 
then there is 
nothing I desire anymore

The revolving time 
took away the sun
Before I realized, the night 
were wrapping the world 

In this way, 
time unconcernedly flies 
If then 
I'll grow old and die
What am I 
living for? 

I walked 
while dragging out
my almost breaking heart
Seeking for 
a sliver ray of hope
I was almost crushed 
by the anxiety 
writhing in the darkness
Even so, 
tomorrow will return 
for anybody

Until the day comes
when I can love my reflection 
tainted in regret, 
that's reflected in the mirror, 
Today too, 
I'll continue to live 
while crying

I walked 
while dragging out
my almost breaking heart
Seeking for 
a sliver ray of hope
If you're holding this hand
that trembling in loneliness, 
then there is 
nothing I desire anymore
nothing I desire anymore
