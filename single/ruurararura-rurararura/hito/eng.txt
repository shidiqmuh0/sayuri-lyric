I've always 
found it strange, 
but nothing I can do
It has a form 
like a human
Calling myself as a boy
What is 
that thing called? 

My routine will be ending
without any problems
The problem is 
humans who blame it
No matter 
how many times 
we disagree, 
the answer won't be 
that easy to understand 

The whole world 
has been torn apart 
by a line of pieces
I'm grateful 
to have a light 
that is getting dimmer 

I've always 
found it strange, 
but nothing I can do
Humans easily die 
from the invisible feelings
and it happens 
over and over

Even though 
it'd be a relief if I just 
disappeared somewhere 
without seeing anything
But those who 
deliberately oppose that 
are humans
No matter 
how many times we fight,
it'd only hurt other people 

The world map is visible 
when I'm 
in the midway 
of blinking my eyes
Until the light 
has rotten
at the end of the dream 

The whole world 
has been torn apart 
by a line of pieces
I'm grateful 
to have a light 
that is getting dimmer 

The world map is visible 
when I'm 
in the midway 
of blinking my eyes
Until the light 
has rotten
at the end of the dream 
I'm grateful 
to have a light 
that has completely
gone away
