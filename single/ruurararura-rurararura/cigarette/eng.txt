I exhale 
the secondary smoke 
along with your saliva
I've completely gave up
Even if I scratched you, 
even if I cry screaming, 
you'll never stop 

I drove out 
the secondary smoke
along with your stale love
But my heart 
is full of smoke 
and it's annoying

I'll even 
show off 
my other valuable things
I purposely dropped 
the contents of my pocket 
and let you 
picked them up 

I understand 
it won't come true
I don't need 
anymore couples stuffs
That's why 
please don't talk 
about it again

I swallow 
the secondary smoke 
along with 
two points of distance
I've completely gave up
Even if I scratched you, 
even if I cry screaming,
looks like 
we're still connected 

I exhale 
the secondary smoke
Even though 
I kiss your lips,
I won't be able 
to steal your past
It's very, 
very bitter 
Ah~

I understand 
it won't come true
I don't need 
anymore couples stuffs
That's why 
please don't talk 
about it again

I understand 
it won't come true
I don't need 
anymore couples stuffs
That's why 
I'll bid you farewell
soon

Full of nothing
but things I don't know
After all,
you're still a children
I know
without being told like that

Are?
My tears won't stop
See, after all
I'm still a child
