I thought 
we wanted to understand each other
But the light never reached the darkness 
nor the lowness
of the sky without sun

I thought 
we wanted to share pain together
But my crying voice never reached you
From that distance, you'll never see
The coldness nor the bitterness
of the night of cold sun

This world keeps changing,
but you and I won't change
I wonder why
you can say
such sweet words like that?
This world keeps changing, 
but you and I won't change
The light that pierced
those sweet words into my heart 
is so cruel

I'm not such a person
who can live simply like that
But still, I must keep on living
You are so happy, 
saying such 
irresponsible words
I try to hide my laugh
without fully understanding it
Those pains that  
you'll never realize forever

This world keeps changing,
but you and I won't change
You could say 
such such sweet words 
because you're strong

I thought we wanted 
to understand each other
The light never reached me
From that distance, you'll never see 
the weak nor the ugly parts of me
who fear of the sun

If this world is full with light
I know, I'll definitely disappear
But you, 
who never know such things
are crueler than darkness

This world keeps changing,  
but you and I won't change
The light that pierced 
those sweet words into my heart 
is so cruel
