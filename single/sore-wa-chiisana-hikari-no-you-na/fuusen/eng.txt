I'm getting lighter and lighter
You've plundered all of my everything
You've sucked everything up
and completely gulped it down

I'm getting weaker and weaker
But because you'll clearly rinse away
the dark stains inside my heart
I'll be getting fine without doing anything

I get deflated
after you remove my air
Ah, that means I'm already yours

“If I lose every little thing,
It's your fault,  don't you realize?"

No matter how many times
I always say that 
and keep hitting you
But I wonder, 
do you even completely 
understand those words?

I'm getting 
lighter and lighter
And you accept
every little part of me

I don't even need to worry
I'll be getting fine 
without doing anything

I'm getting lighter and lighter
You've plundered all of my everything
You've sucked everything up
and completely gulped it down

Ah
I'm getting lighter and lighter
Ah
I'm getting weaker and weaker
Ah
I'm getting deflated rapidly
Ah

I get withered
after you remove my air
That means  
I'm no longer can survive by myself

If I lose every little thing,
It's your fault,  don't you realize?
No matter how many times
I always tell that 
and keep hitting you 
But I wonder,
why do you still stay by my side?

“If I lose every little thing,
Ah Aah A
It's your fault,  don't you realize?"

No matter 
how many times
I always say that 
and keep hitting you
But you'll completely understand 
even those words, right?

Oh Oh Ooh
