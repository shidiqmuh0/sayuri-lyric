I'm a fish, 
breathing using gills
I live inside 
the soundless aquarium
Listening carefully 
to your voice
Even if I can't hear it  
But I want to hear your voice

I'll give you mine
so you won't drown
My delusion every night, 
having a secret date with you 
And it'll be ended today

I'll jump up to your place
Just before I die,
Show me a dream 
for the last time
Please, 
I hope you could suck up
my fading breath

I'm a fish, 
breathing using gills
Swaying and wavering, 
The light blue poem 
Just for once, I'd like to touch
those beautiful scales of yours

"Taking you along with me 
to the deep sea,
Keep diving, deep and even deeper
And the two of us 
will be living there happily ever after"

I'll jump up 
to your place 
Just before I die, 
I saw a dream for the last time
Me who couldn't live here,
became bubbles then vanished

I'll jump up to your place
Just before I die, 
Show me a dream 
for the last time
Please, 
I hope you'll always
bloom beautifully forever
