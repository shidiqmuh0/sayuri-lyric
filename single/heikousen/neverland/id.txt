"Once the tomorrow comes,
I'll cast a magic spell
so that everything will be changed."
You who are laughing 
saying things like that,
only can dabble in shallow water

"I've cast a magic spell
for every bad guy to vanish from this world" 
You who are laughing 
saying things like that
still don't understand even a bit

I surrender myself
to this tight sticking bluff
I'm trying to abandon my daily lives
I know, you can't dive and
just pretend to drown, right?

Every things I like are fading away
As if staying 
in a dark and narrow place
Can't find something you like or what
You only do nothing 
but throw a tantrum

"One day, 
I shall change everything."
Harbor such ideals
You thought that you are superior
just because of having 
such a noble dream?

I devote myself
to someone's story
You who have lost  
in your own words,
just pretend to fly,
fascinated by the light, right?

If I were a child,
I could sleep day and night,
and continue on living
by blaming others
I never ever want 
to be an adult  
Can I continue only living
by looking down on the others?

Such a guy like you
Such a guy like you
Such a guy like you
Such a guy like you

Every things I like are fading away
I'm sleeping,
covered by this sick, painful world
I can't wake up yet
I don't want
I don't want
Only do nothing but throw a tantrum

Every things I like are fading away
It's so cold and painful
I arrange nothing but grumbling
Can't find something I like or what
I only do nothing 
but throw a tantrum
I don't want, I don't want
Only do nothing but throw a tantrum
