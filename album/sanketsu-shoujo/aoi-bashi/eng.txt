On the Shinjuku Station platform at sunset
You seem to stand alone on that white line
With the sole of dirty sneakers being white
And swayed earrings from the horizontal field of view
At that moment, I was suddenly reminded of something
But blocked by the passing train

I'm waiting for you to finish your part-time job
But there is a story I can't tell
The days keep repeating, greeting as usual

We both continue to plant seasons to be harvested
Red or blue, how beautiful will the scenery be?

We both continue to plant seasons to be harvested
What can we see at the end of this journey?

I like analog cameras
I also like the distinction between normal blur and motion blur
We can't recognize the name of that plant
Even so, let's keep staring at it
Let's slowly pat it

Let's take a photograph
With a focus on this crowded city
The calmness was the same as the crowd that passed

I'm waiting for you to finish your part-time job
When our eyes meet each other
I don't understand the meaning or direction of our relationship

We both continue to plant words to be harvested
While praying that we can meet again

We both continue to plant our seasons to be harvested
While hoping that we can stay here

It's feels like

Flowers that are like jewels
Flowers that become clear
