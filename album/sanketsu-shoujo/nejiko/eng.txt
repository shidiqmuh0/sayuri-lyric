The new skirt is blown by the wind
Even the difficult tasks ahead,
A girl will smile and struggle

Although we want to step forward straight
We turn a bit because of our fear
It's better to simply ignore it

Wear anxiety, carry scars
Fear feels beautiful
I'm heading for tomorrow together with you

Let's sing the freedom that overflows
Let everything dance on this hand
There will be no more problems
There's only a path that's illuminated by light
Let's sing the freedom that overflows
We don't need anything except in this hand
Destroy that fear with love and happiness
Sunny day

Let's drink the regrets that are fused with juice
If we're ready, let's go to the place today
Trembling feet when riding a train
It's okay to step on it a little
Then look out the window

We're dreaming with full of hobes
With these rubbing hands
Even though we're bad, we choose tomorrow

Let's continue to grow from the bottom up
The spine grows to the sky like a flower
Even though we can't get through the crowd well
With views shining here and there
It okay if there are days when we fall
Now record all the surprises and failures

It's love that's scratched with many color of failure
When we face the breeze
The entrance is the exit

Let's sing the freedom that overflows
Let everything dance on this hand
There will be no more problems
There's only a path that's illuminated by light
Let's sing the freedom that overflows
We don't need anything except in this hand
Destroy that fear with love and happiness
Destroy that fear with love and happiness
Sunny day
